## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

```{r cars}

install.packages("productplots")
library(productplots)
data(happy, package = "productplots")
```
1. Data cleaning: the values “IAP”, “DK” and “NA” all encode missing values. Replace all of these instances by the value NA.
```{r}
HAPPY <- HAPPY %>% mutate(
  happy = factor(tolower(HAPPY))
) %>% select(-HAPPY)

levels(HAPPY$happy)
```
```{r}
library(classdata)
data("happy", package="classdata")
head(happy)
```

```{r}
happy <- replace(happy, happy == "IAP", NA)
happy <- replace(happy, happy == "DK", NA)
happy <- replace(happy, happy == "NA", NA)
```
2.Check the type of the variable and cast into the right type (factor variable for categorical variables). For age, change “89 OR OLDER” to 89 and assume the variable should be numeric.
```{r}
happy %>% str()
happy <- happy %>% mutate(
  age = replace(AGE, AGE == "89 AND OLDER", 89),
  age = as.numeric(age)
) %>% select(-AGE)

HAPPY %>% ggplot(aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```
3. Bring all levels of factors into a sensible order. For marital you could e.g. order the levels according to average age.
```{r}
happy <- happy %>% mutate(
  degree = factor(tolower(DEGREE)),
  degree = factor(degree, levels=c("lt high school", "high school", "junior college", "bachelor", "graduate school"))
) %>% select(-DEGREE)

HAPPY %>% ggplot(aes(x = degree)) + geom_bar()
```
Part 2
```{r}
data(happy, package="reshape2")
```

```{r}

avgs %>% ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = happy)) +
  geom_point(shape=2, aes(y= healthy))


```
The point being investigated here is seeing how the age relates to a persons happiness and health. The script is unfortunately not working, however, this plot should hypothetically show us if there is an association with a person's age, health, and happiness levels. Age and health are predicted to have an inverse relationship.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
